Almost every day, new ideas turn into businesses. Companies frequently launch new software and products to meet changing customer needs and stay ahead of competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to business, every product has information about it that serves or solves problems in today\'s world. For users, documentation is always the first stop to understand the product.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n![Documentation Matters](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1455390582262-044cdead277a?w=1200&h=400&fit=crop)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Documentation Matters\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomers expect instant answers. They don\'t want to wait for support tickets or spend time on long phone calls. Instead, they always turn to documentation first, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Release notes** (to see what\'s new or improved)\\r\\n- **FAQs** (for common questions)\\r\\n- **Troubleshooting guides** (for solving problems)\\r\\n- **How-to articles** (for completing tasks)\\r\\n- **Technical docs** for software\\r\\n\\r\\n## Documentation: The Backbone of Business\\r\\n\\r\\nDocumentation is like the backbone of any business. It makes onboarding new team members seamless, encourages knowledge sharing, and reduces the risk of losing valuable know-how when people move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs your company grows, documentation keeps everyone aligned, so you don\'t lose momentum or run into costly knowledge gaps.\\r\\n\\r\\n### For Larger Organizations\\r\\n\\r\\nFor larger organizations, robust documentation keeps things running smoothly across different teams and locations. It helps with:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Compliance**\\r\\n- **Streamlined training**\\r\\n- **Consistent best practices**\\r\\n- **Faster product launches**\\r\\n- **Easier market expansion**\\r\\n\\r\\n## Self-Service: The Modern Customer Expectation\\r\\n\\r\\nToday\'s customers love self-service. They want to find answers on their own, whenever they need them, without waiting on hold or submitting a ticket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-quality documentation\u2014think clear instructions, troubleshooting guides, and FAQs\u2014makes this possible. Not only does this free up your support team, but it also builds customer loyalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn crowded markets, being known for excellent documentation can set you apart and keep customers coming back."},{"id":"cloud-computing-basics","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cloud-computing-basics","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-24-cloud-computing-basics.md","title":"Cloud Computing Basics","description":"Discover how cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP) transforms businesses by solving infrastructure challenges and enabling global scalability.","date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"cloud-computing","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-computing"},{"inline":true,"label":"aws","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws"},{"inline":true,"label":"azure","permalink":"/blog/tags/azure"},{"inline":true,"label":"gcp","permalink":"/blog/tags/gcp"},{"inline":true,"label":"technology","permalink":"/blog/tags/technology"}],"readingTime":4.42,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Roushan Gupta","title":"Senior Technical Writer","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/roushan"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Roushan901.png","key":"roushan"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"cloud-computing-basics","title":"Cloud Computing Basics","authors":["roushan"],"tags":["cloud-computing","aws","azure","gcp","technology"],"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop","description":"Discover how cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP) transforms businesses by solving infrastructure challenges and enabling global scalability."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Great Documentation Helps Businesses and Users Scale Worldwide","permalink":"/blog/why-documentation-matters-for-business"},"nextItem":{"title":"Docs as Code Approach","permalink":"/blog/docs-as-code-approach"}},"content":"Have you ever wondered how your apps, online stores, or business software run seamlessly no matter where you are?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is **cloud computing**. I understand how powerful this technology can be and want to share how cloud computing can turn small ideas into big successes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n![Cloud Computing](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?w=1200&h=400&fit=crop)\\r\\n\\r\\n## In this post, you\'ll discover:\\r\\n\\r\\n- What cloud computing is and why it matters\\r\\n- The most common business challenges companies face with traditional IT\\r\\n- How cloud computing solutions address those problems\\r\\n- Why cloud computing has become so popular for businesses of all sizes\\r\\n\\r\\n## Challenges Before Cloud Computing\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we dive into the details of cloud computing, let\'s first understand the major challenges that businesses faced before it came along.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning a great idea into an app or online store used to be a huge challenge for people all over the world. It wasn\'t just about creativity\u2014you needed a lot of money and technical skills right from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s what businesses everywhere had to deal with:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Buying and maintaining their own servers and equipment\\r\\n- Hiring IT and security experts to keep things running\\r\\n- Paying for buildings, electricity, and constant upkeep\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Sudden Traffic Surges Can Crash Your Website\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine you have an e-commerce application that typically handles 20,000 customer visits every second. As your business grows, you decide to host a major event\u2014like a Super Sale or Big Billion Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, your website traffic spikes to 1 million visits per second. Can your app handle this massive surge? Most likely not, because it wasn\'t designed for such extreme loads. **The result: your site crashes**, and you lose both sales and customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent this, you might invest in extra servers to handle the peak traffic. However, once the sale ends and your traffic drops back to the usual 20,000 visits per second, those extra servers are no longer needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though they sit idle, you still have to pay for and maintain them because you own the equipment. This means you\'ve spent a lot of money on resources that are rarely used, making it both wasteful and expensive for your business.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Expanding Globally Requires Huge Investments\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to grow your business into new countries or regions, you can\'t just launch your website and expect it to work everywhere. You need to set up servers and data centers close to your new customers to ensure fast, reliable service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis also means hiring IT staff in each location to manage and maintain your infrastructure. All of this requires a significant upfront investment\u2014buying hardware, renting space, and building teams\u2014before you even know if your business will succeed in those markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Maintenance and Upgrades Are Costly\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you own your own servers and software, you\'re responsible for keeping everything running smoothly. This means you need to hire IT experts to manage your systems, fix hardware issues, and handle unexpected problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou also have to regularly upgrade your hardware and software to stay secure and up to date. All of these tasks require both time and money.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Security and Data Protection\\r\\n\\r\\nProtecting your website and customer data from hackers is entirely your responsibility. You need to set up strong security systems, monitor for threats, and create reliable backups to prevent data loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding and maintaining these security measures not only takes time and expertise but also increases your costs. If you don\'t get it right, your business and customers could be at serious risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5. Slow to Launch and Make Changes\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting up your own servers and systems isn\'t quick\u2014it can take weeks or even months before everything is ready. When you want to introduce new features or support more customers, making these changes often involves complex upgrades and careful planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis slow, complicated process means you can\'t respond quickly to market demands or new opportunities. As a result, your business may miss out on growth and fall behind competitors who can move faster.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How Does Cloud Computing Solve These Problems?\\r\\n\\r\\nCloud computing changes everything. Instead of buying and managing your own servers, you:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Rent computing resources from cloud providers like **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**\\r\\n- Pay only for what you use, and scale up or down as needed\\r\\n- Let the cloud provider handle maintenance, security, and updates\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s like renting an apartment instead of building a house\u2014you use what you need, and someone else takes care of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cloud Computing\\r\\n\\r\\nCloud computing is the delivery of computing services\u2014such as servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet. It lets you access what you need, when you need it, without owning or managing any physical hardware.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Benefits of Cloud Computing\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Cost Savings**: No big upfront costs; pay-as-you-go pricing\\r\\n- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove resources as your business grows\\r\\n- **Accessibility**: Work from anywhere with an internet connection\\r\\n- **Automatic Updates**: Cloud providers keep everything up to date and secure\\r\\n- **Disaster Recovery**: Your data is backed up and protected\\r\\n- **Collaboration**: Teams can work together in real time\\r\\n- **Security**: Leading providers offer strong security features\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s Next?\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding the basics of cloud computing is just the beginning. In my next post, I\'ll dive deeper into the different types of cloud models and top global market leaders."},{"id":"docs-as-code-approach","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/docs-as-code-approach","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-23-docs-as-code-approach.md","title":"Docs as Code Approach","description":"Learn the Docs as Code methodology - manage documentation like source code with Git, CI/CD, and modern developer workflows.","date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docs-as-code","permalink":"/blog/tags/docs-as-code"},{"inline":true,"label":"documentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/documentation"},{"inline":true,"label":"technical-writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/technical-writing"},{"inline":true,"label":"devops","permalink":"/blog/tags/devops"},{"inline":true,"label":"git","permalink":"/blog/tags/git"}],"readingTime":2.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Roushan Gupta","title":"Senior Technical Writer","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/roushan"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Roushan901.png","key":"roushan"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"docs-as-code-approach","title":"Docs as Code Approach","authors":["roushan"],"tags":["docs-as-code","documentation","technical-writing","devops","git"],"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1618401471353-b98afee0b2eb?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop","description":"Learn the Docs as Code methodology - manage documentation like source code with Git, CI/CD, and modern developer workflows."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Cloud Computing Basics","permalink":"/blog/cloud-computing-basics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to Tech Docs","permalink":"/blog/welcome-to-tech-docs"}},"content":"Welcome to my blog on the **Docs as Code** approach!

Let\'s get started!\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is the Docs as Code Approach?\\r\\n\\r\\n**Docs as Code** is a methodology where documentation is created, managed, and published using the same tools and workflows as software development. Instead of treating documentation as something separate, it\'s handled just like source code.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Docs as Code, documentation is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Written in plain text formats like **Markdown** or **AsciiDoc**\\r\\n- Stored in version control systems such as **GitHub** or **Bitbucket**\\r\\n- Built and deployed using **CI/CD** tools like **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**\\r\\n- Reviewed and improved through pull requests (PRs)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach is popular among:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Technical writers\\r\\n- Software developers (especially for developer documentation)\\r\\n- DevOps teams\\r\\n- Product engineering teams (maintaining APIs, SDKs, and developer tools)\\r\\n\\r\\n## How Does Docs as Code Work?\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s a typical Docs as Code workflow:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Writers create or update documentation files\\r\\n2. Changes are submitted via a pull request (PR)\\r\\n3. Reviewers (writers or engineers) provide feedback\\r\\n4. Once approved, the PR is merged\\r\\n5. Automated pipelines build and publish the updated documentation\\r\\n\\r\\n## Key Benefits of Docs as Code\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: Docs are updated alongside code, so information is always current when features launch.\\r\\n- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Developers and writers work together using the same tools and workflows, making contributions and reviews seamless.\\r\\n- **Version Control & Traceability**: Every change is tracked\u2014see what changed, who changed it, and why. Easily roll back if needed.\\r\\n- **Increased Efficiency**: Automation speeds up publishing and reduces manual work.\\r\\n- **Consistency & Quality**: Automated checks, style guides, and peer reviews keep documentation uniform and high-quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Essential Tools for Docs as Code\\r\\n\\r\\n| Tool | Description |\\r\\n|------|-------------|\\r\\n| **Visual Studio Code** | Free, open-source, and highly customizable code editor. Supports Markdown, live preview, Git integration, and many extensions. |\\r\\n| **Git** | Distributed version control system. Tracks every change, supports branching, merging, and rollback for transparent history. |\\r\\n| **GitHub** | Web-based platform for hosting/managing Git repositories. Enables pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and automation. |\\r\\n| **GitHub Actions** | Built-in CI/CD service for GitHub. Automates workflows like building and deploying documentation whenever changes are merged. |\\r\\n| **Docusaurus** | Static site generator for documentation. Converts Markdown files into professional, searchable, and mobile-friendly websites. |\\r\\n\\r\\nDocs as Code is more than a trend\u2014it\'s a practical, proven approach that brings the best of software development to the world of documentation."},{"id":"welcome-to-tech-docs","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-to-tech-docs","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-23-welcome-to-tech-docs.md","title":"Welcome to Tech Docs","description":"Welcome to Tech Docs by Roushan Gupta - your go-to platform for technical writing, cloud computing, and DevOps insights.","date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"introduction","permalink":"/blog/tags/introduction"},{"inline":true,"label":"technical-writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/technical-writing"},{"inline":true,"label":"documentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/documentation"},{"inline":true,"label":"cloud","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud"},{"inline":true,"label":"devops","permalink":"/blog/tags/devops"}],"readingTime":0.9,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Roushan Gupta","title":"Senior Technical Writer","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/roushan"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roushan-g-99242299/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Roushan901.png","key":"roushan"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-to-tech-docs","title":"Welcome to Tech Docs","authors":["roushan"],"tags":["introduction","technical-writing","documentation","cloud","devops"],"image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499750310107-5fef28a66643?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop","description":"Welcome to Tech Docs by Roushan Gupta - your go-to platform for technical writing, cloud computing, and DevOps insights."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Docs as Code Approach","permalink":"/blog/docs-as-code-approach"},"nextItem":{"title":"Turn Your Documentation Search Box into SuperSmart Search","permalink":"/blog/ai-powered-documentation-search"}},"content":"Hello, my name is **Roushan Gupta**.
