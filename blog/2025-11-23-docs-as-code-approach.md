## What is the Docs as Code Approach?

Docs as Code is a methodology where documentation is created, managed, and published using the same tools and workflows as software development. Instead of treating documentation as something separate, it's handled just like source code.

With Docs as Code, documentation is:

- Written in plain text formats like Markdown or AsciiDoc
- Stored in version control systems such as GitHub or Bitbucket
- Built and deployed using CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- Reviewed and improved through pull requests (PRs)

This approach is popular among:

- Technical writers
- Software developers (especially for developer documentation)
- DevOps teams
- Product engineering teams (maintaining APIs, SDKs, and developer tools)

## How Does Docs as Code Work?

Here's a typical Docs as Code workflow:

1. Writers create or update documentation files
2. Changes are submitted via a pull request (PR)
3. Reviewers (writers or engineers) provide feedback
4. Once approved, the PR is merged
5. Automated pipelines build and publish the updated documentation

## Key Benefits of Docs as Code

- **Improved Accuracy:** Docs are updated alongside code, so information is always current when features launch.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Developers and writers work together using the same tools and workflows, making contributions and reviews seamless.
- **Version Control & Traceability:** Every change is tracked—see what changed, who changed it, and why. Easily roll back if needed.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automation speeds up publishing and reduces manual work.
- **Consistency & Quality:** Automated checks, style guides, and peer reviews keep documentation uniform and high-quality.

## Essential Tools for Docs as Code

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Visual Studio Code** | Free, open-source, and highly customizable code editor. Supports Markdown, live preview, Git integration, and many extensions. |
| **Git** | Distributed version control system. Tracks every change, supports branching, merging, and rollback for transparent history. |
| **GitHub** | Web-based platform for hosting/managing Git repositories. Enables pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and automation. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Built-in CI/CD service for GitHub. Automates workflows like building and deploying documentation whenever changes are merged. |
| **Docusaurus** | Static site generator for documentation. Converts Markdown files into professional, searchable, and mobile-friendly websites. |

Docs as Code is more than a trend—it's a practical, proven approach that brings the best of software development to the world of documentation.
